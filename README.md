# Overview

This program is a pretty basic form of a To-Do List Manager. It will have a menu you can navigate by inputting the corresponding
number to the menu option you want. It will allow for the creation and deltion of "Tasks" from your list. Along with the option
to display your entire list.

Future functionality will be added, but  for now this is to show an understadning of some principles of the C++ language. Including
the different libraries and .cpp and .h files.

I hope this program will serve as a good regerence for me in the future to see where I can improve and to review what I have learned.
Along with allowing others to see a small section of my skills in areas relating to C++. Along with the potential for my continued
growth through comments and corrections about my code.

The following link is to my demonstration of the code as of January 26, 2024.

# Development Environment

I started with Visual Studio Code as that was the IDE I have used the most. But found C and C++ to be rather difficult to manage
and by following some sugestions from friends I changed the the Visual Studio Comunity version. I found this to be a learning curve
in itself as the IDE was much more in depth than others I had used, and being new to Git as well it took me a while to understand how
set everything up to my liking.

I found the C++ language itself to be a somewhat demanding language. Trying to learn pointers and then how to iterate and remove items
from a list was an experience. But being able to look back and see how the language "only does what I tell it" is nice. In comparison
to Python, C++ allowed me to have more control and know more about what my code was doing. It may take more research to understand how
to use the <algorithm> library but it also shows exactly what the code requires and does behind the scenes.

I find this to be refreshing as I feel I can understand how each line does something, rather than just  knowing it does something.
From my research it seems that most people agree that this language is good for memory management, and versatility. Due to you
knowing exactly what each line does, and how much space it uses you can very easily control each aspect of the code. It simply takes
the time to learn what each function, and line does.

# Future Work

A few of the items I wish to add to this program:

- An Edit feature for Tasks in your list
- More user error cathes to direct the user toward valid input
- A Date system to organize or show priority of each Task
